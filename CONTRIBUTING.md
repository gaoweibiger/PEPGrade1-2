// Example component structure
import React from 'react';
import { SomeIcon } from 'lucide-react';

interface ComponentProps {
  // Define props with TypeScript
}

const Component: React.FC<ComponentProps> = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  // Component logic
  
  return (
    <div className="responsive-classes">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

### Speech Functionality
