For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

### **Project Requirements Template**

**1. Project Type & Tech Stack:**
* I need to create a **Single-Page Application (SPA)**.
* Please use the following tech stack: **React** + **TypeScript** + **Vite** + **Tailwind CSS**.

**2. Final Deployment Platform:**
* This project will ultimately be deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

**3. Build & Configuration File Requirements:**
* Please ensure the correct build configuration for Cloudflare Pages is provided (Build command: `npm run build`, Output directory: `dist`).
* Please create a `_redirects` file in the `public` folder, suitable for an SPA, to handle client-side routing.

**4. Code Robustness Requirements:**
* Please add a global **Error Boundary** to the React application's root component (`App.tsx`) to catch and gracefully handle any rendering errors, thus avoiding a blank screen.
* Please add a simple **Loading Indicator** in `index.html` to show a "Loading..." message to the user before the JavaScript has completely loaded, in order to improve user experience.
* Please clean up any unused resource links from the template in `index.html` (e.g., the default `vite.svg` icon) and replace it with a simple inline Emoji or SVG icon.
